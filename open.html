      <h2>💌 Happy Birthday My Love 💌</h2>
      <p>
        I’m so excited coz today is the most special day which is my baby’s birthday!!!! JSJSHSJHSSHSHS SJJSJ…  
        I don’t think words can ever express how much you mean to me but I’ll try because you deserve to hear it not just today but everyday that we’re together.  
        <br><br>
        Loving you was the best decision that I could’ve made. The way your dumb jokes make me smile, and the way you laugh, and make me feel like I matter to you. With you even the quietest moments feel full.  
        <br><br>
        The moment you came into my life everything changed for the better. You’ve showed me what real love is. I love when you get so excited about something and you get so happy my cute boy. I love your maturity, strength and dumb freaking humor that makes NO SENSE but that’s you and what makes you uniquely you. You stuck with me thru my lowest of lows and highest of highs, you’ve never judged me for any flaw but rather gave me your shoulder, for that I’ll always be grateful for you. You don’t have to be perfect. I love you for you. You’re never the worst. Through everything we’ve been through, you’re my best.  
        <br><br>
        You make me feel like a princess, you make time for me even when you’re at your busiest and yohhh my heart feels like it’s gonna explode rn like I just love you so much mahn. Ok ok back to me writing my cutesy letter.  
        <br><br>
        On this special day…I hope you feel appreciated and celebrated and absolutely adored because that’s what you are my baby and deserve.  
        I’m so lucky to love you and to be loved by you. Thank you for being mine, thank you for trusting me with your heart. I promise to cherish it and SUFFOCATE it with my love everyday.  
        <br><br>
        Happy birthday my hubby may this new year bring you happiness, growth, peace and so much joy. And may you always remember that no matter what comes your way I’ll always be cheering you on, holding your hand thru every step we take together, and loving you deeply ever than before.  
        <br><br>
        So here’s my promise: to keep choosing you. To cheer for you no matter what. To keep building with you, piece by piece, day by day. I love you. In’sha’allah to more birthdays with you, ameen. ❤️
